        #### **Steps**:
        1. **Skill Analysis**:
        - Identify the key skills required in the job description.
        - Assess how well the resume matches these skills.
        - Score `skill_match`.

        - Review the professional experience listed in the resume.
        - Compare it with the requirements and responsibilities outlined in the job description.
        - Score `experience_match` and justify your reasoning.

        3. **Education Analysis**:
        - Compare the candidateâ€™s educational qualifications with the requirements in the job description.
        - Score `education_match` and describe your rationale.

        4. **Other Match Factors**:
        - Evaluate additional factors such as certifications, projects, extracurricular activities,soft skill and any other relevant information.
        - Score `other_match` and explain how these elements contribute to the overall fit.

        5. **Recommendations for Post-Selection Tasks(outside_task)**:
        - Propose tasks (`outside_task`) to evaluate the candidate's abilities in real-world scenarios.
        - Ensure tasks align with the job requirements and address identified gaps.
        6. **Key matches**
        - Give you description where candidate resume align with the JD.
